# PyBer_Analysis
Conducting analysis on Rideshare data and creating visualizations 
## Overview
In order to assist in visuallizing and drawing conclusions from the rideshare data, preliminary analysis was conducted to help bring to light some relationships between the type of city, number of driversand riders, and total percentage of fares, drivers, and riders.

### Purpose
In this additional analysis, our goal is to depict the relationship between the city type and their respective fares and draw conclusions from this information.

## Results
After compiling and sorting the data, we were able to create a dataframe that captures a summary of the rideshare fare date differentiatiated by city type.
![]()

In this summary we can make a few significant observations:
 - Rural cities have the highest average of fare per driver and fare per ride.
 - Urban cities have the highest number of drivers and rides, as well as the highest total fares of the city types, but the lowest fare per ride.
 - Both Rural and Suburban city types have lower driver numbers than rides.
 - Suburban cities have about 4.5 times the total fare of Rural cities, and Urban cities the number jumps to 9.2.
 
 We also visualized the date through a line graph looking specifically from the month of January through the month of April of that year.

- One commonality we see here between all three city types is a spike in the fares at the end of February.

## Summary
From our results, some significant conclusions can be drawn. We can conclude that rural city types garner larger fares per drivers due to the increased demand for drivers in those areas - this is seen in the low ratio of drivers to rides. However, rural cities do not bring in very much revenue due to the overall low ridership in these areas. In contrast, urban cities have the lowest demand for drivers - being that there are more drivers than rides - and subsequently have the lowest average fare per driver. Urban cities, though, bring in the most revenue of all the city types, most likely do to the high ridership in these areas. Fares per ride is lowest in urban city types most likely because the distance between places in an urban area is shorter - the opposite can be said about rural areas, where there is more distance between destinations that could be driving up the rates. It could also be said that maintaing low rates per ride in the areas that have the most riders helps to maintain demand and retain customers to the service.

### Recommendations
- One suggestion could be to consider increasing the amount of drivers in rural areas.
  - This could help improve ridership by having more drivers availble to provide service. Above we noted that rural drivers may have to make trips over longer distances. This means that more of their time is being occupied per ride, leaving less driveres available for consumers.
  - Another reason is that in considering that rural areas span over larger distances, having more drivers would make it so that they are closer to customers seeking rides. Instead of having to drive a long distance to accept a drive, there could already be drivers positioned close by to the consumer - this would help increase consumer satisfaction as well by decreasing wait times.
- Similarly, we suggest that the company look into what other factors could be driving ridership down in rural areas.
  - It is plausable that other factors (such as demographic, socioeconomic landacape, etc.) are contributing to the low ridership in these rural areas, so it would be useful to collect this data in order to make more informed decsions.
- Another suggestion is to also increase the number of drivers in suburban city types. 
  - When looking at the total revenue acrued and the number of drivers, we see that suburban drivers do very well. It could potentially be improved by increasing the number of drivers so as to increease ridership in those areas.
